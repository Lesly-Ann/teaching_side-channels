# Lab: Caches and Microarchitectural Timing Attacks

## Build website
```bash
./jekyll.sh build    # Build site
./jekyll.sh serve    # Start dev server
./jekyll.sh watch    # Build and watch
./jekyll.sh clean    # Remove generated files
./jekyll.sh install  # Install dependencies
```

This lab contains materials for learning about cache-based side-channel attacks and microarchitectural timing vulnerabilities.

## Platform Requirements

⚠️ **These exercises require x86-64 architecture**

They will **not work** on ARM-based systems (e.g., Apple M1/M2, Raspberry Pi).

Content adapted from:
- **KU Leuven's course on Computer Architecture**: [https://cass-kul.github.io/exercises/7-cache/](https://cass-kul.github.io/exercises/7-cache/)
- **MIT course on Secure Hardware Design**, available at [https://shd.mit.edu/home/](https://shd.mit.edu/home/). They have many more super cool open-source lab sessions on microarchitectural security so if you're interested, I strongly recommend to try it out!
